## Startup Expansion Data Analysis and Visualization
This repository contains the data analysis and visualization project focused on the expansion of a startup across various states. The analysis is performed using Python, and the visualizations are created using Power BI.

 ## Project Overview
In this project, we analyzed the startup's expansion data to gain insights into key metrics such as profit, ROMS (Return on Marketing Spend), and revenue. The goal was to identify trends and patterns that could inform future business decisions.

## Key Features
Interactive Dashboards: Visualizations that allow for dynamic exploration of the data.
Geographic Analysis: Insights into the performance of different regions.
Metric Highlights: Focus on profit, revenue, and marketing spend efficiency.
